Block:   Census Report
Date:    March 28th - 2011
Version: 2012051802
Release: 2.2.3.1

The new version of the census report includes a number of different display options, which will
be explained below.  In general each display option can be set in two locations.  There are local
settings which can be configured on the individual blocks and global settings which are inherited
from the main block configuration.  The main block configuration also includes an "Override Local
Settings" option which will force all blocks to use only the global configuration and ignore their
local settings.  When the blocks have been overridden this is indicated by a message at the top of
the block.
